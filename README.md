# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock-truetech
Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock code for TrueTech assessment. The Brief was as follows:

# Rock Paper Scissors
Using any language of your choice please create a program which allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer which makes random choices for their Turn.\
Please put this into a git repository and provide the URL to TT, this is the code we will talk about during your interview.\
We expect you to spend no longer than 2 hours on this task.

## Further Goals
If you wish to extend your submission here are suggested extensions, you could add if you have time.

## Last Choice Computer Player:
Build a second computer player which always plays the same move the human did in the previous turn.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock:
Add a game mode where you can use the iconic Lizard / Spock moves as made famous by the Big Bang Theory.\
If you need more information on these moves, see Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors  

# My Comments:
Completed this assessment on 04/07/2025 in 2 hours, including the stretch goals. I chose to use JavaScript since it's my most comfortable language and would allow me to implement an interactable UI with ease.
